### Hello, I'm Soundarya! ðŸ‘‹
Step into my portfolio, where I, a student and former data specialist, showcase projects spanning diverse disciplines for both academic and hobby exploration. This collection represents my ongoing learning journey.

Please note: The data utilized in these projects is sourced from publicly accessible outlets and is purely for demonstration purposes.

As I'm in the initial phases of constructing my portfolio, the current listing features a handful of projects. I'll continue to update and expand it as I complete more projects in the future.
